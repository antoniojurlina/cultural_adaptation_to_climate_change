Preliminary Theme2 Data Science Work
Antonio Jurlina
Jan - May 2021


# Project Goal
Theme 2 of the Barracuda grant is focused on 'cultural adaptation to climate change,' including a major effort to measure and estimate cultural adaptation among farmers across the United States. To accomplish this, we create a national dataset which can be used to detect the key patterns of cultural adaptation. Cultural adaptation to environmental change may occur when (a) an environmental change, causes (b) a behavioral change which proves to be (c) beneficial for those who adopt it, and consequently (d) spreads among the population. In addition we will want to collect (e) socio-economic data which may contribute to likelihood of adaptation. Cultural adaptations might be small (such as a change in technical method) or large (such as a major change in subsistence, economic model or lifeway). The goal of this semester-long project is to begin the effort of data integration and testing.


# Specific tasks
This semester-long effort includes a set of specific tasks. Each task should be iterative, and improve our collective ability to create reproducible research. 
(1) research and document the relevant data sources
 - find data sources which can supply data to help address each of facet (a-e) of cultural adaptation, above.
 - document the spatial, temporal and sociological extent, resolution and focus of each source.
 - document the access details for each data source.
 * Compile a simple report on data sources by facet (a-e).

(2) assemble a preliminary dataset
 - develop a dataset/database using a small regional test case (e.g. New England or Maine, 1980-2010)
 - collect data form the data sources identified in (1) for the test case.
 - identify challenges with integrating these datasets (e.g. spatiotemporal grain, extent, units)
 - complete a preliminary merger of data addressing each facet (a-e) in the test case.

(3) draft a data integration pipeline or plan for future more in-depth work.
 - document your efforts
 - describe the data sources in detail, and means of accessing each
 - describe the data integration effort, it's limitations, successes, and lessons learned
 - describe weaknesses in reproducibility, automation, access, storage 
 - make a set of suggestions for ongoing work



# Initial data source leads
(a) environmental change --
 - ?
 - ?


(b) behavioral change  --
 - USDA ERS - ARMS Farm Financial and Crop Production Practices, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/arms-farm-financial-and-crop-production-practices.aspx
 - CropScape (USDA NASS) - https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/


(c) beneficial for adopters --
 - USDA NASS, farm economics
 - United states census
 - ?


(d) population spread --
 - same data sources as (b), but over time, e.g. via spatial autocorrelation


(e) socio-economic predictors --
 - SEDAC/CEISIN â€“ rasterized social data - https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/
